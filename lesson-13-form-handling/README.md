## We need server-side to handle form submissions.

Static files are for `GET` requests, which browser _gets_ the files from static file server. For `POST`, the data is _post_ to server and then need further logic and computation power to process it.

We will explore both Netlify form and form-to-email services.

### Netlify Form

Pros & Cons

Pros

- Easy to use: Just create a form and Netlify handles everything for us
- Anti-spam handled.
- Support file upload.

Cons

- 100 form submissions per month
- External service = external branding
- No after-submission redirection
- Not supporting multiple file input.


### Form-to-email service

Example: FormSubmit.co

Documentation: https://formsubmit.co/

Pros

- Easy to use: Post form to https://formsubmit.co/your_email@example.com and activate it to use.
- Anti-spam handled.
- After-submission redirection.
- Support file upload.

### Build your own form by using Lambda function

An alternative way is to build our own form handling via Lambda function.

We will cover more on that later when using Netlify functions. 


## Tackling spams

Netlify form and those form-to-email services usually come with built-in recapcha or suspecious spam filtering. In additin, we can add honeypot field to the form to further prevent spamming bot.
