## About this course

In this course, we learn JAM stack by using [11ty](https://11ty.dev) and [Netlify](https://netlify.com) hosting.

There are three components in JAM Stack, Markup, JavaScript and API.

In the first part of the course, we will focus on the Markup part of the JAM stack.

We will use static site generator 11ty to create our pie generated website.

In part 2, we will extend the site by using Netlify hosting. It provides several essential server-side functions. By using different services and their APIs, we can make our site dynamic. Then in part 3, we will use JavaScript to further enhance our use of the APIs and services.
