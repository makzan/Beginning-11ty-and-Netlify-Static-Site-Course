## Drag-n-drop to deploy

We can deploy static website as easy as by dragging the folder into Netlify.

Here is a short video demonstrating this.

## Going beyond static

We can go beyond static by adding the following technologies:

- Git commits for continuous deployment.
- Single-page JavaScript-basd utilies.
- Form submissions via server-side helpers.
- Dynamic server-side logic via lambda functions.

## Usage example


- Video promotion
- Minimal personal website
- inQRCode.com
- draw.mz-lab.com
- Quick hosting of presentation materials.
- https://learning-deck.netlify.app/
- Web books.
- mak.la Short URL redirection

We will learn more on enhancing static one-page website with more functionalities in later lessons.
